# Project g²

GitHub makes it trivial to create and maintain new projects.  However,
the standard username-oriented workflow implies a bus factor of one.
While Git makes it easy to fork projects and patch them elsewhere,
establishing a single new upstream is non-trivial.  The purpose
of **project g²** is to move open source projects created by [@mgorny](https://github.com/mgorny/)
(and hopefully more [@Gentoo](https://github.com/gentoo/) developers in the near future) to a single
shared organization where they could be maintained with a higher bus
factor.

## The rules

1. It's all about trust and mutual respect.  Everyone in the organization
   gets write privileges to all repositories.  Don't abuse these
   privileges and respect the original maintainers of the projects.
2. Source repositories only.  Please don't fork repositories into
   the organization just to create a pull request.

Behind every programmercat, there is a netadmincat:
